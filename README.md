AI-Driven Employee Wellness and Productivity Tracker

Objective: Build an AI-based platform that tracks employee productivity metrics (e.g., project completion rates, time spent on tasks) and correlates them with wellness data (e.g., stress levels, absenteeism, survey responses).
Novelty: The platform should suggest personalized interventions (break times, counseling) and productivity boosters using AI models trained on behavioral data.
Enterprise Use: Improves employee well-being and enhances productivity across teams.
